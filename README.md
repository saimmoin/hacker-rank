# Project Goals

- Enhance your DSA skills by tackling HackerRank's algorithm problems in JavaScript.
- Explore various solutions for each problem and learn from different approaches.
- Contribute your unique solutions and engage with the community.

# Structure

- Each file represents a separate HackerRank problem statement.
- Files are organized logically (categories/custom structure).
- Each file includes:
  - Problem title (name/ID)
  - Problem description (requirements/constraints)
  - Solution(s):
    - Function definition(s) with comments
    - Time and space complexity analysis
    - Optional algorithm explanation
  - Test cases to verify correctness and edge cases
  - Optional additional notes
